This folder contains the stuff we have created for a workshop Sensemakers did on the WON2019 manifestation in OBA.
Some 30 secondary school pupils were building a weather station on a the Sensemaker's SMA8266A demo board (see the [wiki](../../../wiki/Sensemakers-ESP8266-demo-board) in this repo).
Software is obviously writtten in Micropython, on top of the SMA8266A.py library from this repo. The add-on library for WON and 6 sample main.py are here.
For further information see the [Sensmikers site](https://www.sensemakersams.org/won-workshop-2019/).
