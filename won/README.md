This folder contains the stuff we have created for a workshop Sensemakers did on the WON2019 manifestation in OBA.
Some 30 secondary school pupils are building a weather station on a the Sensemaker's SMA8266A reference board (see the wiki in this repo).
Software was obviously writtten in micropython, on top of the SMA826 6A.py library. The add-on library for WON and 6 sample main.py are here.
